### Description

Operating Systems I (Linux) explores the concepts, terminology, and
fundamental features of operating systems in general and the Linux
operating system in detail. The characteristics of a multi-user,
multi-tasking, multi-threaded operating system will be examined in
detail. Aspects of connectivity using TCP/IP protocols, and application
services such as FTP, SSH, and web servers will be introduced. The
command-line user interface will be the central focus, allowing the
student to use shell commands, the **vi** editor, utilities and bash
scripts to construct and use command sequences to manipulate data and
perform basic system administration tasks. A Linux graphical user
interface will be introduced and explored. Projects will include
installation and configuration of the operating system on a host machine

**Program and course rules and regulations:**

***For 420 career program courses, students must receive at least 50% on
the assignment component and at least 60% on the examination component
in order to obtain a passing grade for the course. Failure to do so will
result in a maximum grade of 50 (the lower of 50 or the grade earned).
For the purpose of this rule, quizzes are considered exams.***

Assignments are due at the due date specified by the instructor.
Assignments received after this time are late. Assignments will not be
accepted after due date set by instructor. In exceptional circumstances,
such as illness, etc. labs submitted late will be graded provided that
the student has received an extension from the instructor in advance.

Each student must submit their own individual answers to assignments,
and shared solutions are not acceptable. Students must protect their
work from being easily copied by others by introducing uniqueness into
their work in the choice of images used, the display styles used in the
presentation of documents, the originality of the written descriptive
passages, and by placing digital signatures on their original images.

Students are reminded that they are responsible for all material
presented in the lecture and during the lab, and are expected to obtain
material they have missed.

Students must follow exactly the instructions in the lab exercises about
how and where to store all computer files in order for their work to be
accepted and properly evaluated.

**DAWSON COLLEGE**

**COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT**

**POLICIES**

**1. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

The Computer Science Department adheres to the Dawson College Academic
Conduct policy. Students have an obligation to inform themselves of all
aspects of this policy. According to ISEP, the teacher is required to
report to the Sector Dean all cases of cheating and plagiarism affecting
a student's grade. (ISEP Section V-C) Students may appeal any decision
of the teacher regarding cheating and plagiarism according to the
methods established by the College. The penalty for cheating or
plagiarism may range from a zero on the work to a failure in the course.

**2. ATTENDANCE AND LATENESS**

Students are responsible for all material covered in classes and labs,
whether or not they are present. Students have an obligation to arrive
on time and to remain for the duration of scheduled classes, labs and
activities. Students who disregard this obligation may be asked to leave
the class, lab or activity. Students should refer to the Institutional
Student Evaluation Policy

(ISEP section IV-C) regarding attendance.

**3. RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE**

Class period(s) may be cancelled in order that the teacher can observe
religious holidays. Any material missed as a result, will be made up
during labs, class periods and alternate tutorial sessions.

Students, who intend to observe religious holidays, must inform their
teachers in writing as prescribed in the ISEP Policy on Religious
Observances (ISEP Section IV-D). Students absent from classes because of
observance of religious holidays will not be penalized. It must be
emphasized, however, that this College policy should not be interpreted
to mean that a student can receive credit for work not performed. It is
the student's responsibility to fulfill the requirements of the
alternative arrangement.

**4. SOFTWARE**

The Computer Science Department forbids the use of the computer labs it
uses to make any copies of any software without the explicit
authorization of the Department. Apart from any legal action that might
arise from such unauthorized copying, the Computer Science Department
reserves the right to discipline any student involved in such activity.

Students who borrow software from the College and fail to return it will
be placed on the defaulter list and be subject to the appropriate
penalties.

Viruses are programs that attach themselves to a computer system without
the permission of those to whom the system belongs. They are
deliberately written to be, at worst, harmful (e.g. destroying the
contents of disks) and, at best, bothersome (e.g. disturbing the image
shown on the screen). They can cause serious losses of time and effort
for students, staff and faculty. Any student involved in the deliberate
spreading of viruses is subject to the most severe penalties prescribed
by College regulations, apart from any legal action that might arise
from such acts.

**5. LITERACY**

The Computer Science Department recognizes that literacy in all its
forms (read, written, spoken) is essential to our students in their
careers.

Teachers may choose to incorporate a literacy component into the marking
scheme for any piece of work. Teachers may use their discretion to
insist that any piece of work submitted for credit is revised by the
student if it is unsatisfactory with regard to literacy.

Teachers will inform all students in their courses of this policy at the
beginning of each semester either by including it in the course
description or otherwise.

**6. CELL PHONES**

The use of cell phones in all Computer Science lectures, labs and exams
is prohibited.

**7. PORTABLE COMPUTERS**

The use of portable computers in all Computer Science lectures for
purposes other than note-taking is prohibited.

**8. STUDENT CONDUCT**

Everyone has the right to a safe and non-violent environment. Students
are obliged to conduct themselves as stated in the Student Code of
Conduct and in the ISEP section on the roles and responsibilities of
students. (ISEP section II-D)

**9. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT POLICY**

Students who are enrolled in the Computer Science Technology careers
program must conduct themselves according to the Professional Conduct
Policy as described in the Program Handbook

**10. INTENSIVE COURSE CONFLICTS**

If a student is attending an intensive course, the student must inform
the teacher, within the first two weeks of class, of the specific dates
of any anticipated absences.

**11. ISEP**

The Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP) is designed to
promote equitable and effective evaluation of student learning and is
therefore a crucial policy to read and understand. The policy describes
the rights and obligations of students, faculty, departments, programs,
and the College administration with regard to evaluation in all your
courses, including grade reviews and resolution of academic grievance.
The ISEP is available on the Dawson website.
