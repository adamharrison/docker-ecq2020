* update predis to predis/predis suggests installing ext-phpiredis (Allows faster serialization and deserialization) the model training is slow
* move app to separate repo instead of tar & cp if this is done, remove the COPY, use git and then I don't need zip/unzip for predis?
* test on Azure, AWS, Google cloud digitalocean, Heroku, Openshift
